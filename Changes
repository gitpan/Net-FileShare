1.01  Sat Jan 18 03:21:05 2003
	- added server_run_once sub, for use in the testing process...
	- fixed problem with the _recv_packet sub.
	- worked on some more fun loving pod

1.02  Sat Jan 18 13:06:05 2003
	- added tests to distribution
	- tested the first installation of module as Net::FileShare

1.03  Sat Jan 18 13:23:56 2003
	- made additions to pod and updated the server_run_once and DESTROY_SELF subs

1.04  Fri Jan 31 09:10:02 2003
	- fixed the SYNOPSIS area in pod for FileShare.pm
	- added error checking to the send_cmd() sub. This will check for invalid packet types from server and client, and if they exist, croak.

1.05 Tues Feb 11 17:00:03 2003
	- fixed test.pl (the tests for the distro)
	- bundled in Test::Simple to be used with test.pl
	- fixed problems in the server_run_one and DESTROY_SELF subs. I had over zelously used croak(), which was causing problems with my tests.
	- Added a README file to the distribution.
	- Added a TODO file to the distribution.
	- Fixed area in client_connection sub, which takes a file_name. Instead of checking for a blank file by seeing if it's eq to " ", check lenght($file_name) eq 0.
