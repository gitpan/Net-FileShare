This is a readme file for Net::FileShare, a utility for creating file sharing clients and servers by Gene Gallistel <gravalo@uwm.edu>.

* Installation

Net::FileShare uses the standard Perl module install process:
perl Makefile.PL
make 
make test
make install

* Usage

Here is an example of a file sharing server:
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use FileShare;

my ($fh) = FileShare->new(_send_only => 1,
			  _socket    => 1,
			  _directory => '/path/to/files/to/serve',
			  _debug     => 1);
  $fh->server_connection;


and here is an example of a file sharing client:
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use FileShare;

my ($fh) = FileShare->new(_send_only => 0,
			  _socket    => 1,
			  _directory => '/home/usr_id',
			  _debug     => 1);
  $fh->client_connection("x.x.x.x", "port", "some_file");

 Unless a port is specified, the server_connection defaults to using port 3000. Just so you know.
 Also, servers currently only handle one client, and one file transfer at a time. Check out the TODO file for info on further updates.
